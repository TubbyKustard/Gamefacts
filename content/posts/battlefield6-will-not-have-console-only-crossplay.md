Despite an earlier interview with a Battlefield Studios developer suggesting Battlefield 6 would include a console-only cross-play option, [Dexerto](https://www.dexerto.com/battlefield/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-wont-have-console-only-crossplay-after-all-3252439/) reports that EA has confirmed otherwise. Instead, console players who choose to disable cross-play will be limited to matchmaking solely within their own platform.
