Avalanche Studios, best known for the Just Cause franchise, Rage 2, and Mad Max, is facing major restructuring. Following the suspension of development on Microsoft’s Contraband, the company announced plans to close its Liverpool studio and lay off staff across its Malmö and Stockholm offices. In a [statement](https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update), Avalanche said, "In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studio Group's long-term success.

This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."
