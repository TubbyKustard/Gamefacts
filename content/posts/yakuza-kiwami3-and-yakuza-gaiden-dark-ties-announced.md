Announced during RGG’s Direct, Yakuza Kiwami 3 will be a full remake of Yakuza 3, rebuilt with RGG Studio’s Dragon Studio engine. The remake will feature expanded areas in Okinawa, new story scenes, re-recorded dialogue, enhanced animations, and more.

Launching alongside Kiwami 3—and included with Kiwami 3—is the spin-off Yakuza Gaiden: Dark Ties. This prequel focuses on the antagonist of Yakuza 3, exploring their past and the events that ultimately lead to their confrontation with Kiryu.
