The very first Grand Theft Auto launched on MS-DOS and Windows on November 28, 1997.
GTA IV released on April 29, 2008—a span of 10 years, 5 months, and 1 day.

Today marks 12 years since the release of GTA V (September 17, 2013). In that time, Rockstar has not released another mainline GTA title. Instead, we only saw one handheld spinoff (GTA: Chinatown Wars for PSP and Nintendo DS) and two expansions for GTA IV (The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony).

That means GTA V has now been around longer than the entire gap between GTA 1 and GTA IV—a period that also included Vice City and San Andreas.
