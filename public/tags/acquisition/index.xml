      <description>&lt;p&gt;As reported late last week by multiple outlets, Electronic Arts was in serious talks on a historic $50 billion buyout. Today, at a press conference, EA announced that it has reached an agreement for $55 billion, which would place the company under Saudi ownership, primarily funded through the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan, which aims to reduce the kingdom’s reliance on oil by expanding into sectors such as entertainment, technology, tourism, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
