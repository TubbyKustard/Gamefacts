      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Games has officially announced that New World: Aeternum is entering its final phase of support. Following major company layoffs, the studio confirmed that no new content will be developed — though servers will remain online through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amazon recently announced widespread job cuts — roughly 14,000 positions company-wide — affecting multiple divisions, including Amazon Games. As part of these changes, New World: Aeternum will no longer receive new content updates. The Season 10: Nighthaven update will serve as the game’s final major release. Amazon said the decision came after it became “no longer sustainable” to continue full development support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
