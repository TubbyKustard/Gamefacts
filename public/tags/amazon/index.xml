Following major company layoffs, the studio confirmed that no new content will be developed — though servers will remain online through 2026.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;amazon-recently-announced-widespread-job-cuts--roughly-14000-positions-company-wide--affecting-multiple-divisions-including-amazon-games-as-part-of-these-changes-new-world-aeternum-will-no-longer-receive-new-content-updates-the-season-10-nighthaven-update-will-serve-as-the-games-final-major-release-amazon-said-the-decision-came-after-it-became-no-longer-sustainable-to-continue-full-development-support&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Amazon recently announced widespread job cuts — roughly 14,000 positions company-wide — affecting multiple divisions, including Amazon Games. As part of these changes, New World: Aeternum will no longer receive new content updates. The Season 10: Nighthaven update will serve as the game’s final major release. Amazon said the decision came after it became “no longer sustainable” to continue full development support.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server and Player Info&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Servers will remain live through 2026, allowing current players to continue exploring and playing as usual. The team plans to give at least six months’ notice before any shutdown or major service changes. While New World is still listed on the Microsoft Store, it has already been delisted from Steam. Amazon says the game will stay available for purchase “until further notice.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
